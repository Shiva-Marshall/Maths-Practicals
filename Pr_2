np.linalg.matrix_rank.rref(A) is a function in the NumPy library that calculates the reduced row echelon form (RREF) of a given matrix A.
The RREF is a useful representation of a matrix as it shows the row operations performed to make the matrix in row echelon form


# Importing numpy in python
import numpy as np

# Define the matrix

A = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])

# Calculate the RREF

rref_matrix, pivots = np.linalg.matrix_rank.rref(A)  # It is a special function to find the Row-Reduced Echleon Form

print("RREF of the matrix:")
print(rref_matrix)
