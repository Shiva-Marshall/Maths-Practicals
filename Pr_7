You can check the linear dependence of vectors in Python by computing their rank and comparing it to the number of vectors.
If the rank is less than the number of vectors, the vectors are linearly dependent


# linear dependence of a set of vectors in Python using the numpy library:

import numpy as np

# Define the set of vectors
vectors = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [2, 4, 6], [3, 6, 9]])

# Compute the rank of the set of vectors
rank = np.linalg.matrix_rank(vectors)

if rank < vectors.shape[0]:
    print("The vectors are linearly dependent.")
else:
    print("The vectors are linearly independent.")


# linear combination of given vectors in Python,

import numpy as np

# Define the set of vectors
vectors = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [2, 4, 6]])

# Define the coefficients for the linear combination
coefficients = np.array([2, 3])

# Compute the linear combination of the vectors
linear_combination = np.dot(coefficients, vectors)

print("The linear combination of the vectors is:")
print(linear_combination)
